# Root railway.toml – used when a service has Root Directory = empty (e.g. brainscraper).
# Other services use their own: chimera-core, chimera_brain, scrapegoat, brainscraper/railway.toml
#
# For brainscraper: set Root Directory = EMPTY so /Dockerfile is used (context=repo root).
# Set NO_CACHE=1 for first deploy to clear cache, then remove.
